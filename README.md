Obtaining API Key
Many services require using a user identifier to access the API - this identifier is called an API key. When you access the API, you should provide the API key along with your request.
This method allows the service to track the usage of the API from different users, and possibly to apply rate limiting, for example, to make sure you don‚Äôt overuse the API.
To get an API key for OMDb, click on the ‚ÄúAPI Key‚Äù at the navigation menu. Enter your email, and choose "Free account". Go to your inbox, you should find there an email from the website with your API key. If you don‚Äôt see the email, check your Spam. Click on the activation key to activate your API key. Now you can use it in all future requests!

Use It With Python
Read the specification of the API in OMDb API home page. Use the t param to search a single by title, by making a request to:
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&t=titanic
You can try it in your browser, and via Python code. Verify that you can access the API and get results.
